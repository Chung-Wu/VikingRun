=====Feedback==============
A lot of things isn't taught in class, like how to control more than one buttons with the same script file.
The speaker used two script files in order to perform the Exit function and Start function, but it is not nessesary.Only one script file is enough. 
In addition, the speaker seems like not very professional in the coding since sometimes he debugged for a long time , wasting the time or even didn't fix the bug.
As for the homework, viking run, we dont have enough time to finish it.
It's about the end of term, a lot of homeworks and even we got another homework in this class.Needless to say the exams.
It's undeiable that I learned a lot in unity, and it's fun as well.But the homework is too hard to finish.
